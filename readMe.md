# Refactoring a back end
## Description
This is a refactoring project, moving the service from a back end using an express server with routes to a back end using express and apollo querying through graphQl.  
## Usage
Clone the repo to your device, run npm i, run npm run develop.  
## Problems
The mutation call to add books to the save books and the query call to load books do not function properly.  The query to load books specifically results in the saved books page to not load correctly, sending the user to the error page.  
## Examples
